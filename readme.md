# Leabra

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/benureau/leabra)

This repository holds a Python implementation of the Leabra (Local, Error-driven and Associative, Biologically Realistic Algorithm) framework. The reference implementation for Leabra is in [emergent](https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page) developped by the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory](https://grey.colorado.edu/CompCogNeuro/index.php/CCNLab) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/). This Python implementation targets [emergent 8.0](https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Changes_8.0.0) (as of September 1, 2016).

This work is the fruit of the collaboration of the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory](https://grey.colorado.edu/CompCogNeuro/index.php/CCNLab) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/) and the [Mnemosyne Project-Team]() at [Inria Bordeaux, France](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
