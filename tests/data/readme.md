This directory contains data files generated by emergent, that are used to check that the python and
emergent implementation produce the same behaviorâ€”quantitatively.

* **neuron.dat**: `CycleOutputData` from the Neuron tutorial, with added averages data (`avg_ss`,
  `avg_s`, `avg_m`, `avg_s_eff` and `avg_l`). Adapt and short-term plasticity deactivated.
  - generated from `emergent_projects/neuron.proj`

* **neuron_adapt.dat**: same as `neuron.dat`, with `adapt.on` set to true.
  - generated from `emergent_projects/neuron.proj`

* **convolve_nxx1.txt**: precomputed convolution of the noisy XX1 data.
  - generated from `emergent_projects/neuron.proj`
  - emergent r9985, with modifications in the source code to display that data.

* **neuron_pair.txt** and **neuron_pair_inhib.txt**, with inhibition in InputLayer spec off and on
  respectively.
  - generated from `emergent_projects/neuron_pair.proj` (TrialOutputData)
