This directory contains data files generated by emergent, that are used to
check that the python and emergent implementation produce the same behaviorâ€”
quantitatively.

* **neuron.txt**: `CycleOutputData` from the Neuron tutorial, with added averages data
  (`avg_ss`, `avg_s`, `avg_m`, `avg_s_eff` and `avg_l`). Adapt and short-term plasticity deactivated.
  Generated from `emergent_projects/neuron.proj` with emergent r9985.

* **neuron_adapt.txt**: same as `neuron.txt`, with `adapt.on` set to true.

* **convolve_nxx1.txt**: precomputed convolution of for the noisy XX1 data.
  Generated from `emergent_projects/neuron.proj` with emergent r9985,
  with modifications in the source code to display that data.

* **neuron_pair.txt** and **neuron_pair_inhib.txt**, generated from the
  TrialOutputData of `emergent_projects/neuron_pair.proj`, with inhibition in
  InputLayer spec off and on respectively (emergent r10073).
